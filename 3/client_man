.SH DESCRIPTION
.B client
reads input from stdin as a sequence of T<n> & S<N> commands, connects to the
port number at the specfied ip address, and sends T<n> commands to that port
for the server to listen to. 

When first connecting, the client will send a 20 Byte Hostname for the server in
the form of machinename.pid, then it starts to parse the input from file.

The client will run Sleep(n) if a S<n> is encountered; the server when 
recieving T<n> from client will run Trans(n). After client sends a T<n> to 
server, it waits to hear confirmation as an integer which is the transaction 
number. 

The client prints all of these actions to stdout
.B (1).
When the client reaches end of input, it will print total transactions sent to
server and exit.

." This is the note section
.SH NOTES
.PP
client autoexits when input stops in that if a client does not recieve input 
within a certain timeframe, it will exit without warning

.B (1)
client has a print variable when true doesn't effect stdout, when false
redirects stdout to a logfile named machine.pid

.B client will exit if the server isn't already running
, so make sure to run server first.
