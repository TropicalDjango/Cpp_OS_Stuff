.SH SYNOPSIS
.B server [port]
.PP
.B port 
is the port number to listen for client on

." This is the description section
.SH DESCRIPTION

server waits for any socket activity using status() with timeout of 30 seconds.

If status() returns a timeout, server will close all sockets, print summary info
and exit.
.B (1)

If status() returns error, server will exit with error.

If status() returns server socket activity, server will try to connect to any
available client sockets and will add its socket id and name to client_socket and
client_name respectivly

if status() returns client socket acitivty, server will iterate through all
client sockets and find the one that status() detected. 
Afterwards, server will attempt to read the command from the client, if that 
fails, the client disconnected and its socket is removed; its transaction 
count and name persist.

If command was read successfully, then server will read n for the command and
execute Trans(n). Then servers sends the transaction number for the recieved
command and prints all these actions to 
.B STDOUT (2)

.SH NOTES
.PP

.B (1)
server has a timeout of 30 seconds.

.B (2)
STDOUT gets redirected by the variable print. If print is true STDOUT is left
alone, if false STDOUT gets redirected to a log file of name machinename.pid
I assumed that server doesn't have a logfile since the description makes it seem 
as though only client has a logfile.
